    <h1><u><b>J's Favorite Key Lime Pie Recipe</b></u></h1>

    <h3><em>History behind Key Lime Pie</em></h3>
    This sweet and tart pie reportedly originated in Key West, Florida, in the late 19th century. The use of sweetened condensed milk, an essential ingredient, is probably because fresh milk and refrigeration were uncommon in the isolated Florida Keys until the 1930s.

    <h3><em>How to Store Key Lime Pie</em></h3>
    The pie needs to be served chilled, so keep it in the fridge until you're ready to slice and serve. Whipped cream will hold for a while, but if you're making this pie ahead of time, wait to whip the cream and top the pie until you're ready to present it.

    Have leftovers? Cover the pie plate in plastic wrap, and keep it in the fridge up to 3 days.
