    <h1><u><b>J's Favorite Easy Beef Tacos</b></u></h1>

    <h3><em>Who is responsible for the taco?</em></h3>
    It originated from Mexican silver miners in the 18 th century. Gunpowder was wrapped in a paper like a “taquito” and inserted into rocks before detonation. By this time, tacos were known as the food of the working class, which included miners.
    
    <h3><em>How long can I store the leftovers?</em></h3>
    If stored properly, leftover taco fridge can be stored in the fridge for 3-4 days. So, if you plan on using it in 3 to 4 days, you can easily put it in the fridge. However, if you want to use it later on, and not in the next 3 to 4 days, you should freeze it.

    our 1/2 cup oil in a medium size skillet, heat over medium high heat. Carefully dip a tortilla, if the oil sizzles and bubbles then it's hot enough. Gently lay the tortilla in the oil and fry each side for about 30 seconds, just enough to give some color and add some crispness. <p></p>
